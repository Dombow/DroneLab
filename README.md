## Introduction - Context of Forest Fires and Their Impact
A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in the wildland vegetation, often in rural areas. Wildfires can burn in forests, grasslands, savannas, and other ecosystems, and have been doing so for hundreds of millions of years. They are not limited to a particular continent or environment.

Wildfire smoke is a mixture of hazardous air pollutants, such PM2.5, NO2, ozone, aromatic hydrocarbons, or lead. In addition to contaminating the air with toxic pollutants, wildfires also simultaneously impact the climate by releasing large quantities of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

## State of the Art
Wildfires pose a significant challenge to emergency response efforts, often due to the vast areas they can cover and the speed at which they can spread. Traditional methods of detection and monitoring, such as satellite imagery and ground-based observations, are limited by their resolution, latency, and the inability to operate effectively under certain conditions (e.g., smoke coverage, nighttime). This paper proposes a cutting-edge solution that integrates AI algorithms with drone swarm technology, aiming to overcome these limitations and enhance wildfire management capabilities.

### 2.1 Satellite Detection
Satellites have emerged as the predominant remote sensing technology across various forestry applications, including the detection of wildfires and the identification of fire smoke within forested areas. This adoption of satellite imagery for forest management and wildfire risk mitigation is widespread, thanks to its ability to cover vast and often inaccessible tracts of land efficiently. Despite their extensive use, satellite-based monitoring systems exhibit significant limitations that can hinder their effectiveness in the early detection of forest fires.

One of the primary drawbacks of relying on satellite imagery for wildfire detection is the challenge posed by the relatively low spatial resolution of these images. This limitation makes it particularly challenging to identify and monitor smaller fires, which are critical to detect in the early stages to prevent spread. Small fire spots, which can rapidly evolve into larger, uncontrollable blazes, might not be discerned at all in satellite images until they have grown to a sizeable extent. As a result, opportunities for early intervention are often missed, undermining efforts to manage wildfires proactively.

Additionally, the temporal resolution of satellites—that is, the frequency with which they pass over the same location—further restricts their utility for continuous forest monitoring. This limitation means that satellites cannot provide real-time or near-real-time data about the state of the forests. There can be significant delays between observations, during which time fires that were undetectable at the first pass may grow beyond initial containment capabilities. The inability to deliver continuous monitoring is a critical shortfall in the context of wildfire management, where conditions can change rapidly.

Furthermore, environmental factors such as cloud cover and adverse weather conditions pose substantial challenges to the effectiveness of satellite-based forest monitoring. These conditions can severely obstruct the satellites' ability to collect clear, usable data of the forests below, leading to gaps in monitoring and potentially delayed responses to emerging fires. Cloud cover, in particular, can render satellite imagery useless for fire detection purposes, as the satellites are unable to penetrate thick cloud layers to assess conditions on the ground. This issue is exacerbated in regions prone to frequent cloud cover or where seasonal variations lead to extended periods of reduced visibility from space.

In summary, while satellite technology plays a crucial role in forest management and wildfire detection, its effectiveness is hampered by limitations related to spatial and temporal resolution, as well as environmental conditions that can obstruct data collection. These challenges underscore the need for complementary technologies and methods to enhance early wildfire detection and ensure continuous, reliable forest monitoring.

### 2.2 UAVs Detection
Drones can fly at lower altitudes than satellites, allowing them to capture images and data with much higher spatial resolution. This makes it easier to detect small fires that satellites might miss. Additionally, drone swarms can be deployed frequently and can cover specific areas of interest on demand, offering real-time or near-real-time data.

Moreover, unlike satellites, which can be hindered by cloud cover or atmospheric conditions, drones can operate below cloud layers, ensuring that data collection is not interrupted which is particularly valuable for monitoring areas prone to frequent cloud cover.

Furthermore, drone swarms can dynamically adjust their coverage area and flight patterns based on real-time data and analytics. This adaptability allows for focused monitoring of high-risk areas, changes in fire behavior, or the emergence of new fire spots, providing a level of situational awareness that static satellite imagery cannot.

Despite the advancements in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technologies, several challenges persist that affect their broader implementation. These challenges encompass issues related to battery endurance, operational stability under adverse weather conditions, the architecture of data transmission systems or the management of airspace. Each of these areas presents obstacles that must be addressed to fully leverage UAVs especially in this specific use case of drone swarms.

### 2.4 AI-Detection Advances
Research found difficulties in implementing efficient detection with Supervised Learning (SL) because these techniques need field experts to select the valuable features. On the other hand, Deep Learning (DL) algorithms can extract relevant and strong features automatically (especially CNN, Tensorflow, PyTorch).

However, these techniques need a very large amount of data and high processing power in the training process.

## Description of Technical Characteristics

### 3.1 Methodology

The methodology for any application for startups or so consists of three core components:
* the development of a robust AI algorithm capable of processing multispectral data for early fire detection and progression modeling,
* the design of an adaptive swarm intelligence framework that enables a fleet of drones to efficiently cover large areas and dynamically adjust their flight patterns based on real-time data,
* the integration of these components into a cohesive system that can operate autonomously or in conjunction with human-led firefighting efforts,

### 3.2 Embedded Sensors
Optical cameras, commonly used in wildfire detection, encounter several significant challenges that can impede their effectiveness. One of the primary limitations is their inability to detect wildfire smoke during nighttime due to the absence of natural light. Additionally, in dense forest environments, the presence of tall trees can obscure the view of wildfire flames, making detection extremely difficult. The performance of optical camera sensors is also highly contingent on environmental conditions, including the angle of sunlight, the presence of clouds, and the creation of shadows, all of which can affect the quality of the captured images and, consequently, the reliability of fire detection.

In contrast, thermal imaging cameras, when deployed on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms, present a potential solution to overcome many of the limitations faced by optical cameras. Unlike their optical counterparts, thermal cameras do not rely on ambient light to detect wildfires. They can identify the presence of a fire through the detection of thermal radiation within the Middle Wavelength InfraRed (MWIR) and Long Wavelength InfraRed (LWIR) spectral ranges. This capability allows for the detection of fires even in conditions of complete darkness or in areas where the flames are obscured by vegetation. However, thermal cameras on UAVs are not without their challenges. These include issues related to the effective distance over which thermal detection is accurate and the generally lower spatial resolution of thermal imagery compared to high-definition optical cameras. These limitations can affect the ability to pinpoint the exact location of smaller fires or to discern detailed information about the fire's characteristics.

To address the inherent limitations of both optical and thermal sensing technologies, the integration of data from both types of sensors—along with other sensor modalities—has become a burgeoning field of interest. This approach, known as sensor fusion, leverages the complementary strengths of various sensing technologies to create a more accurate and comprehensive picture of the environment. In the context of wildfire detection, combining the broad contextual awareness provided by optical cameras with the night-time and smoke-penetrating capabilities of thermal sensors can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of detection. Moreover, sensor fusion is not limited to combining only optical and thermal data; it can also include information from other sources, such as infrared sensors, radar, and chemical sensors, further enriching the data available for analysis.

Sensor fusion has gained prominence across several domains, including autonomous vehicle navigation, precision agriculture, and environmental monitoring, reflecting its versatility and effectiveness. In wildfire detection, specifically, the application of sensor fusion techniques to data collected via UAV platforms represents a cutting-edge approach to overcoming the limitations of individual sensor types. By synthesizing diverse data streams, sensor fusion can facilitate the early detection of wildfires, enabling more effective response strategies and potentially mitigating the impact of fires on ecosystems, property, and human lives.
